1️⃣ What is Wireshark?

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer used to capture, inspect, and analyze network packets in real time.

Definition:

Wireshark captures data packets flowing through a network interface and displays detailed information such as:

Source IP address

Destination IP address

Protocol used (TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.)

Packet size

Payload data

Features:

Open-source and free

Supports hundreds of protocols

Live packet capture

Powerful filtering options

Used for network troubleshooting, security analysis, and learning networking

2️⃣ How to Scan a Particular Network Using Wireshark?

Wireshark does not actively “scan” a network like Nmap.
Instead, it passively captures packets from a selected network.

Steps to Capture (Scan) a Network:

Open Wireshark

Select the network interface:

Ethernet (wired network)

Wi-Fi (wireless network)

Loopback (localhost traffic)

Click Start Capture

Wireshark begins capturing all packets on that network

Generate traffic (open websites, ping, run client-server program)

Stop capture when analysis is complete

Note:

Wireshark captures only traffic visible to your system

On switched networks, mostly your own traffic is visible

3️⃣ How to Filter an IP Address from a Network?

Wireshark provides display filters to isolate specific traffic.

🔹 Filter by Source IP Address
ip.src == 192.168.1.10


Displays packets coming from the specified IP.

🔹 Filter by Destination IP Address
ip.dst == 192.168.1.10


Displays packets going to the specified IP.

🔹 Filter by Any IP Address (Source or Destination)
ip.addr == 192.168.1.10


Displays all traffic involving the IP address.

🔹 Filter IP with Protocol (Example: TCP)
ip.addr == 192.168.1.10 && tcp

4️⃣ Commonly Used Filters (Exam Useful)
Purpose	Filter
TCP traffic	tcp
UDP traffic	udp
HTTP traffic	http
Specific port	tcp.port == 5000
ICMP (ping)	icmp
5️⃣ Uses of Wireshark

Network troubleshooting

Security analysis

Packet inspection

Detecting malicious traffic

Learning network protocols








Different Types of Packet Capture Using Wireshark

Wireshark captures network packets in different ways, depending on the network interface, capture method, and configuration.

1️⃣ Live Packet Capture
Description:

Captures packets in real time from a selected network interface.

Most commonly used capture type.

Examples:

Ethernet (LAN)

Wi-Fi

Loopback (localhost traffic)

Use:

Troubleshooting live network issues

Monitoring active communication

2️⃣ Offline (File-Based) Packet Capture
Description:

Opens and analyzes previously saved capture files

File format: .pcap or .pcapng

Use:

Forensic analysis

Studying captured traffic later

Sharing packet data with others

3️⃣ Ethernet Packet Capture
Description:

Captures packets from wired LAN networks

Includes protocols like ARP, TCP, UDP, HTTP

Use:

Corporate networks

Server communication analysis

4️⃣ Wireless (Wi-Fi) Packet Capture
Description:

Captures packets over wireless networks

Can capture:

Management frames

Control frames

Data frames

Modes:

Normal Mode – captures only own traffic

Monitor Mode – captures all nearby wireless traffic (if supported)

Use:

Wireless security analysis

Network troubleshooting

5️⃣ Loopback Packet Capture
Description:

Captures traffic within the same system

Uses loopback address 127.0.0.1

Use:

Client-server programs running on same machine

Application testing

6️⃣ Promiscuous Mode Capture
Description:

Network interface captures all packets, not just packets addressed to it

Use:

Network monitoring

Detecting suspicious traffic

Note:

Enabled by default in Wireshark

7️⃣ Filtered Packet Capture
Description:

Captures only specific packets based on capture filters

Examples:
tcp port 80
host 192.168.1.10

Use:

Reduces unnecessary data

Focused analysis

8️⃣ Protocol-Specific Packet Capture
Description:

Captures packets of a specific protocol

Examples:

TCP

UDP

HTTP

DNS

ICMP

Use:

Studying protocol behavior

Debugging protocol issues

9️⃣ Remote Packet Capture
Description:

Captures packets from a remote system

Uses tools like:

RPCAP

SSH tunneling

Use:

Monitoring remote servers

Network administration

🔟 Port-Based Packet Capture
Description:

Captures packets using a specific port number

Example:
tcp.port == 5000

Use:

Client-server application analysis

Service monitoring

1️⃣1️⃣ Conversation-Based Capture
Description:

Focuses on communication between two endpoints

Use:

Client-server session analysis

Chat and file transfer debugging

1️⃣2️⃣ Multicast & Broadcast Capture
Description:

Captures packets sent to:

Broadcast address

Multicast groups

Examples:

ARP

DHCP

Use:

Network discovery

IP address allocation analysis
